    "## 💡 Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### On vision models:\n",
    "- **Vision LLMs** can process both text and images — enabling use cases like alt text, image search, document analysis, and more.\n",
    "- Sending an image to the model is as simple as encoding it in **base64** and including it in the API request.\n",
    "- **Moondream** is tiny and purpose-built for image description. Larger vision models like `llava` or `llama3.2-vision` produce richer descriptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### On the broader picture:\n",
    "- Both use cases in this notebook — text and vision — use the **same API pattern**: send a prompt, get a response.\n",
    "- The only difference is the model name and adding an `\"images\"` field.\n",
    "- Ollama supports many vision models. Browse them at [ollama.com/library](https://ollama.com/library) and filter by **Vision** capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Want to improve the alt text?\n",
    "Try editing the prompt in `generate_alt_text()` to change the style:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# More detailed:\n",
    "prompt = \"Describe this image in detail for someone who cannot see it.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# SEO-focused:\n",
